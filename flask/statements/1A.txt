Given two numbers, a and b, write a program that will output the answer when these two numbers are multiplied together.

Input: 

The 1st line contains a number t, which is the number of test cases. 

t lines follow, each line containing two numbers a b, seperated by a space.

Output:

t lines, the i'th of which is the answer (a multiplied by b), to the i'th test case.

Constraints:

1<= t <=10
1<= a,b <= 10^6

Sample Input:

3
1 2
4 5
9 20

Sample Output:

2
